# Nelda-Bot
A Discord Bot that helps artists get inspiration for their next masterpiece.

## Motivation

One of the many roadblocks that artists face when making art is that they don't know what to make next or find good reference images. 

## Features 

- Uses the Unsplash API to find high-quality images that artists can reference
- Uses the Youtube API to get the latest video from an Art Youtube Channel I run
- Sends out a daily notification with an art challenge for the day

## Future Plans

- Want users to be able to add suggestions for the daily art challenge
